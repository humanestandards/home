        content: "### \U0001F91A Humane Standards\n\nThe Humane Standards are based on the Functionality and General Intelligence of the Human body, and provide a list of Indices for Sensible (Fair-Play) Governance (*Management, Curation, Interaction, Harmonization and Optimization of Processes).*\n\nAs a framework which is based on Physical Measures (Biomimicry) it is already Embedded in our Everyday Routines and Rituals, so it has the Capacity to be Activated Instantly in a Global Scale and be Mastered by People from all walks of life. \n\nIn their most essential form, the Humane Standards are a Collection of 5 Families of Indices for Ecosystemic Governance. We may use them to Measure our Self-Reflections, Sentience and Self-Autonomy, which are also the foundations of any possible form of Management.\n\n"
