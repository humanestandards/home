        content: >
          Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is not something to be
          discovered. Languages, Cultures, Religions and Branding are a few
          examples of such a type of technology. Body Language (Gestures) is
          most probably the first and most primitive form of AGI.


          *   Artificial Intelligence Ethics are policies concerning our Social
          Infrastructures and they promote Institutional Change, not the
          development of some crazy computer with uncontrolled temper or the
          support of other kinds of conspiracy theories.


          *   You may rest asured that AI takeover is not a possible course of
          events, as it is a hypothesis lacking proper understanding around the
          Inclusive Nature of Intelligence.


          *   Most Frameworks of Ethics act Reactively to problematic behaviors
          (Emphasizing on Testing People's Competence according to views
          surrounding our Past or our Future), and not Proactively (By
          emphasizing on People's Capabilities in the Here and Now, which are
          more than enough for World Peace and Economic Liberty).


          *   The Humane Standards are a future-proof Proactive Strategy
          concerning Crisis Management and our Collective Well-being. It is a
          tool Leveraging our Common Capabilities and Values, which affect our
          Local Livelihoods everyday.


          *   Our Common Humane Standards concern all Peoples, whether you do
          relate with their content and understand it or not.

          General is our Collective Intelligence, which is all-Inclusive and
          Autonomous. It is Narrow as it expresses a certain Generic Diversity
          (Humane Personality), and Strong as it carries a Characteristic
          Systasis (Humane Body / Infrastructure).

        content: >
          While outwardly, and for millennia - we collectively seek for the most
          Sensible and Sensational form for Remote Autonomy - inwardly, the
          Human Complex is a Constitution of a System of Governance, capable to
          achieve Naturally - all possible kinds of Virtues by Will. Of course,
          we can’t overlook the Fatal Mistakes that we’ve made, but we always
          have the Intuitive Tendency to Revisit and Correct them Humanely, even
          if that is being done by the newer generations who always suffer from
          the mistakes of their families. Afterall, the Best approach is always
          the Kind one.
