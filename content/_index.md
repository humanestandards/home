        content: >
          Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is not something to be
          discovered. Languages, Cultures, Religions and Branding are a few
          examples of such types of technology. Body Language (Gestures) is most
          probably the first and most primitive form of AGI.


          *   Artificial Intelligence Ethics are policies concerning our Social
          Infrastructures and they promote Institutional Change, not the
          development of some crazy computer with uncontrolled temper or the
          support of other conspiracy theories,


          *   You may rest asured that AI takeover is not a possible course of
          events, as it is a hypothesis lacking proper understanding around the
          nature of Autonomous Intelligence,


          *   Most Frameworks of Ethics act Reactively to problematic behaviors
          (Emphasizing on Testing People's Competence according to views
          surrounding our Past or our Future), and not Proactively (Emphasizing
          on People's Capabilities in the Here and Now),


          *   The Humane Standards are a future-proof Proactive Strategy
          concerning Crisis Management and Collective Well-being. It is about
          our Common Capabilities and Values which affect our Local Livelihoods
          everyday,


          *   Our Common Humane Standards concern all Peoples, whether you do
          relate with their content and understand it or not.

          General is our Collective Intelligence, which is all-Inclusive and
          Autonomous. It is Narrow as it expresses a certain Generic Diversity
          (Humane Personality), and Strong as it carries a Characteristic
          Systasis (Humane Body or Framework).

        subtitle: Remote Autonomy for People & Machines.
        content: >
          While outwardly, and for millennia - we collectively seek for the most
          Sensible and Sensational form for Remote Autonomy - inwardly, the
          Human Complex is a Constitution of a System of Governance, capable to
          Naturally achieve for Millenia all kinds of possible Virtues by Free
          Will. Of course, we can’t overlook the Fatal Mistakes that we’ve done,
          but we always have the Intuitive Tendency to Revisit them and Correct
          them Humanely, even if that is being done by the newer generations who
          always suffer by the mistakes of their families. Afterall, the Best
          approach is always the Kind one.
