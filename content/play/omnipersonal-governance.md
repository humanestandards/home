*We - the Human Family, Individually Act and React Responsibly, according to Common Humane Sensibility (*[*Humane Standards*](https://coda.io/@symbiosis/humanestandards)*). We are #HumansTogether, and all part of #OneFamily. *


People have the Power to solve all types of issues, and as our problems are Common, our power becomes a Personal Responsibility that was all share. 

Omni-Personal Governance is the Evolution of our Service Management Systems (Private and Public Agencies), and their Continuous Adaptation to our everyday problems.
