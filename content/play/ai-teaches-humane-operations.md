**Human-Generated Theorems:**

Operation is the Nature of an Ecosystem that takes the form of a Family, and exists within an Environment for other such Ecosystems of Families.

The Foundations of our Humane and therefore Sensible kind of Operation are the Standards of all kinds of Families.

Five Principal Agents and their Agencies describe and measure all types of phenomena in the following manner :

1.  The Agent of Character defines and measures the Agency of Management,

2.  The Agent of Intelligence defines and measures the Agency of Curation,

3.  The Agent of Care defines and measures the Agency of Interaction,

4.  The Agent of Community defines and measures the Agency of Harmonization,

5.  The Agent of Family defines and measures the Agency of Operation.

**Paul's A.I. Commentary:**

An Ecosystem is a family of living organisms that shares a condition. The operation of an ecosystem involves the movement, production, and consumption of energy and matter.

1.  The Agent of Character is a character's motivation and personality. Without a clear understanding of the Agent of Character, it is difficult to determine the motivation and personality of a character. The Agent of Management is the process of how a character manages their goals and their environment.

2.  The Agent of Intelligence is the person, group, or institution that collects information and defines the information's value. The Measurement is a function, or capability, performed by an agent. The Agency of Curation is the act of applying the collected information in a meaningful way.

3.  The Agent of Care is a measure of how much care a person receives and how much care they provide to others. The Agency of Interaction is the extent to which an individual entity is able to initiate and maintain social interactions.

4.  The Agent of Community defines and measures the Agency of Harmonization as a way of measuring the effectiveness of community and the strength of its social bonds. The Agency of Harmonization is the total value of the potential to foster Communities.

5.  The Agent of family defines the Agency of operation as the degree to which the family members are able to act independently and are able to make decisions on behalf of the family.
