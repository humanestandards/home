## Intro

In this Hybrid-Intelligence MasterClass we shall examine the Default and Human-Generated Theorems of the Humane Standards - characterized by the initials HGT, and below them Paul's commentary - which is an Artificial Intelligence Generated content.

## Episode 01

🤓 Humane Standards HGT:

Operation is the Nature of an Ecosystem that takes the form of a Family, and exists within an Environment for other such Ecosystems of Families.

The Foundations of our Humane and therefore Sensible kind of Operation are the Standards of all kinds of Families.

🤖 Paul AI:

An Ecosystem is a family of living organisms that shares a common condition. The operation of an ecosystem involves the movement, production, and consumption of energy and matter.

\__\_

🤓 Humane Standards HGT:

Five Principal Agents and their Agencies describe and measure all types of phenomena in the following manner :

Theorem N1 - The Agent of Character defines and measures the Agency of Management.

🤖 Paul AI:

The Agent of Character is a character's motivation and personality. Without a clear understanding of the Agent of Character, it is difficult to determine the motivation and personality of a character. The Agency of Management is the process of how a character manages their goals and their environment.

\__\_

🤓 Humane Standards HGT:

Theorem N2 - The Agent of Intelligence defines and measures the Agency of Curation.

🤖 Paul AI:

The Agent of Intelligence is the person, group, or institution that collects information and defines the information's value. The Measurement is a function, or capability, performed by an agent. The Agency of Curation is the act of applying the collected information in a meaningful way.

\__\_

🤓 Humane Standards HGT:

Theorem N3 - The Agent of Care defines and measures the Agency of Interaction.

🤖 Paul AI:

The Agent of Care is a measure of how much care a person receives and how much care they provide to others. The Agency of Interaction is the extent to which an individual entity is able to initiate and maintain social interactions.

\__\_

🤓 Humane Standards HGT:

Theorem N4 - The Agent of Community defines and measures the Agency of Harmonization.

🤖 Paul AI:

The Agent of Community defines and measures the Agency of Harmonization as a way of measuring its effectiveness, and the strength of its social bonds. The Agency of Harmonization is the total value of the potential to foster Communities.

\__\_

🤓 Humane Standards HGT:

Theorem N5 - The Agent of Family defines and measures the Agency of Operation.

🤖 Paul AI:

The Agent of Family defines the Agency of operation as the degree to which the family members are able to act independently and are able to make decisions on behalf of the Family.

### Notes

The above commentary has been generated by GPT-3 AI technology, and treated with the minimum possible editing (changes in one or two words). Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. GPT-3 is created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research laboratory.
