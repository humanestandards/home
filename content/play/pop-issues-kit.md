> We are all in this Together

Here is a Tool for the Resolution of Any kind of Issue, either Personal or Professional.

It is a Kit for Proactive Risk Assessment, and it presents in Simple Lists the way that our Human Virtues revolve around our Omni-Personal (Common) Issues.

## The Gamification of Sensibility
# A. About

The following Kit may be used in many ways, as it truly is a Complete Mapping of the Human Complexity (Omni-Personal Human-Centered Design System).

The Tables are part of the Humane Standards Protocol.

You may use this without previous knowledge of what the Humane Standards is about, other than their Self-Explanatory Title.

Our Human Virtues which are Inherited to all people by Design (Functional Capabilities), constitute the fundamental Principles of our Ethical and therefore Humane Standards.

Learn more about (my child) the Humane Standards here:

# B. How to Use the PoP Issues Kit

<aside>
üí° We may follow the Levels described here below, or find our own way.

</aside>

**1st Level**

We Self-Reflect on our Chosen Issue and select which of the following Categories seem like the Source of it:

1. Character
2. Intelligence
3. Care
4. Community
5. Family

**2nd Level**

We Find the Corresponding List to our Chosen Category from the POP Issues Kit, and Select a Fitting Sub-Category from the following ones:

1. Management
2. Curation
3. Interaction
4. Harmonization
5. Operation

**3rd Level**

We further choose which Sub-Category resonates with our Issue, and write our Issue as Part of the List (Add it to the beginning or end of each element, as in the example below)

**4th Level**

Resolve our Issue by tracing it Back to its Source, and then Creating a Journey along its Full Range of Effects mapped out by our list.

To Trace an Issue to its Source, you seek for the 1st element of the chosen List.

That's it.

<aside>
üí° The Meaning, or the study of the Origin (Source) of whatever concerns us, is a matter of General Sensibility (Common Sense).

‚ú® **Example**

- I have an Issue with the State of our Community practices which Sustain Unemployment all around the world.
- I choose the **Community** Category and the List **N#4.**
- Then I select as a subcategory the **N#2** which state it as an Issue of **Curation**.
- I go to the List N#4 and find that the Issue is being Traced as problem with Directional Movements (This is great for Interface Design, but a bit abstract for my understanding at the moment).
- It is difficult for me to approach it in that sense, so I can choose another Sub-Category that feels more Practical to help me Resolve my Issue.
- Now I choose Sub-Category **N#4**, as it is surely the Lack of **Harmonization** that brings up Unemployment.
- I add my Issue in the Beginning of each State of my Issue in the following way:

    4**.4.** Unemployment **Issues derive from Harmonization of:**

    4.4.1. Unemployment Ingredients Empowerment (Antagonism)

    4.4.2. Unemployment Topics Support (Antagonistic Topics)

    4.4.3. Unemployment Recipes Composition (Antagonistic Recipes)

    4.4.4. Unemployment Journals Documentation (Antagonistic Journals)

    4.4.5. Unemployment Challenges Adaptation (Antagonistic Challenges)

    4.4.6. Unemployment Rituals Coexistence (Antagonistic Rituals)

- Now that I can see how Underemployment Affects our Community, I can orchestrate an Initiative around it. But first I wish to Personally Understand which is the Source and Meaning of Unemployment all together.
- The 1st Element of the List states that the Source of Unemployment is the Empowerment of its Ingredients (Nothing fancy - no flying dragons or anything)
- Then a realization comes that - if Unemployment exists because it is Empowered by some Ingredients, the Journey is better approached through the Empowerment of Employment's Ingredients.
- Finally I resolve Unemployment by making it Irrelevant through the following list:

    4**.4. Employment** **Harmonization through:**

    4.4.1. Employment Ingredients Empowerment

    4.4.2. Employment Topics Support

    4.4.3. Employment Recipes Composition

    4.4.4. Employment Journals Documentation

    4.4.5. Employment Challenges Adaptation

    4.4.6. Employment Rituals Coexistence
