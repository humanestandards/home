## Intro

In this 3rd Episode of our Hybrid-Intelligence MasterClass we examine Paul's commentary on the Human-Generated Theorems of the Humane Standards - characterized by the initials HGT. Paul is a GPT-3 AI technology, who's responses are treated with the minimum possible editing (changes in one or two words). Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. GPT-3 is created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research laboratory.

## Episode 03

**ðŸ¤“ Humane Standards HGT:**

Interaction represents the Services that are put into action. These are Management's Social Responsibilities and the Care which is offered to Ecosystems.

The Roots of our Humane and therefore Sensible Interaction are the Standards for the provision of Care.

**ðŸ¤– Paul AI:**

Interaction is the way that we Care for the world and the people in it.

It's not about the tech, it's about the humans.

**ðŸ¤“ Humane Standards HGT:**

Five Principal Standards describe and measure the Foundational Agents of Humane Interaction and their Agency domains in the following manner:

Theorem N1 - Detachment defines and measures the principle of Capacity.

**ðŸ¤– Paul AI:**

Capacity refers to the psychological ability to mentally and emotionally process events in one's life. This capacity is different for every individual, and is measured by a psychosocial assessment called detachment. The amount of detachment an individual has is related to how well they can manage the emotions associated with certain situations.

âŒ˜

**ðŸ¤“ Humane Standards HGT:**

Theorem N2 - Truth defines and measures the principle of Magnitude.

**ðŸ¤– Paul AI:**

Magnitude is the difference between two things and the measurement of a force, physical or otherwise. In order to fully understand magnitude, one must have a sense of what it is and how it is determined.

In order to have truth, a magnitude must exist. In order to have magnitude, two points are needed. In order to have two points, a space must be present. In order to have a space, a medium must be there. In order to have a medium, a force must be at work.

Truth is a property of physical objects and their relations.

âŒ˜

**ðŸ¤“ Humane Standards HGT:**

Theorem N3 - Imagination defines and measures the principle of Coverage.

**ðŸ¤– Paul AI:**

Imagination is a mental process, by which someone creates representations of possible or impossible experiences and events.

This definition suggests that imagination is a way of covering or understanding a given set of knowledge.

âŒ˜

**ðŸ¤“ Humane Standards HGT:**

Theorem N4 - Fallacy defines and measures the principle of Formation.

**ðŸ¤– Paul AI:**

Fallacy is the name of a process in the Universe that causes matter to form. For example, the gas of our atmosphere would eventually come together to form a planet, which would then eventually come together to form a solar system, which would then eventually come together to form a galaxy.

The formation of matter is caused by mistakes. The mistakes create the atoms and molecules that make up the material. Mistakes create a series of changes within the particles that can lead to a different substance. Mistakes occur at the atomic and molecular levels, where energy is exchanged and the potential for change is high.

âŒ˜

**ðŸ¤“ Humane Standards HGT:**

Theorem N5 - Memory defines and measures the principle of Convertibility.

**ðŸ¤– Paul AI:**

Memory is the ability to convert a state of an object to another. In order to convert a thing into another thing, you need to have the memory or knowledge of the thing into which you are converting it.

âŒ˜

**ðŸ¤“ Humane Standards HGT:**

Our Interaction also has Opposite Event Rules, which describe and measure the Limits of the previous Standards:

1.  Non-Detachment defines and measures the principle of Non-Capacity,

2.  Non-Truth defines and measures the principle of Non-Magnitude,

3.  Non-Imagination defines and measures the principle of Non-Coverage,

4.  Non-Fallacy defines and measures the principle of Non-Formation,

5.  Non-Memory defines and measures the principle of Non-Convertibility.

**ðŸ¤– Paul AI:**

1.  Non-Capacity is the idea that people are limited by their physical, mental, and emotional capacities. Non-Detachment defines and measures the principle of Non-Capacity. It is a principle of unsatisfactoriness (dukkha in Buddhism), because it reduces the capacity to contact with the world. It is a principle of insubstantiality, because it reduces any attachment to the world.

2.  Non-Truth is the principle of Non-Magnitude, the idea that there is no such thing as total non-existence. There is only the Magnitude between non-existence and existence.

3.  Non-Imagination is the principle of non-coverage, which is the lack of understanding of a particular risk.

4.  Non-Fallacy leads to Non-Effect, which leads to Incoherence.

5.  Non-Memory is the principle of not being able to be converted from one form to another.
