> The Easiest way to Practice with the Humane Standards.

Mnenomics, or Symbolic Association is the most efficient Learning technique.

The Humane Standards use the limbs of our body, such as our hands to help us explore and remember our Humane Powers in a more intuitive manner.

👌 **E X A M P L E S**

**A. Designating Positions**

![](/\_static/app-assets/LeftHand.png)![](/\_static/app-assets/RightHand.png)

In the above Mnemonic Systems we have Designated Powers to each of our Fingers.



**B. Assigning Relationships**

![](/\_static/app-assets/Reasoning\_.png)

In the Gesture above we use the 1st and 2nd Finger to show a Cyclical Relationship (Loop) between the 1st and 2nd Humane Powers respectively. Then show how the 3rd Power is a Function supporting another Loop (with the 1st and 2nd Powers of another Stellar Format - See below). The rest of our powers are the result of these functions and represented by the rest of the fingers spreading outwardly.

##

# ⭐ Stellar Format

![](/\_static/app-assets/Humane%20Powers.png)

We have converted our Fundamental Humane Capabilities to the proceeding Powers, which are then being visualized through Stellar Formations.

*   Each Stellar Point is being assigned with a Humane Power.

*   There are lots of ways to learn how they associate with each other, and the easiest way is to begin with just One.

*   Choose your favorite Star which contains Powers more Relatable to your work or general personality and use them as a Guide for the Organization of your Operations.

![](/\_static/app-assets/Operations.png)Operation is the Nature of an Ecosystem that takes the form of a Family, and exists within an Environment for other such Ecosystems of Families. 
The Foundations of our Humane and therefore Sensible kind of Operation are the Standards of all kinds of Families.

## 🤔 Problem Solving & Decision Management

Here is a Practical example on how to Practice with the Humane Powers Format:

1.  We choose a Topic we wish to Asses. Something we care to reach a certain Decision and Solve a Problem.

2.  We select our Favorite Stellation, or the one which seems more Relatable to our Topic.

3.  Then we begin Single-Player Sessions or Multi-Player, and expand on the following 3 Directions:

    1.  Sensible Self-Reflection

    2.  Sensible Sentience

    3.  Sensible Self-Autonomy

**E X A M P L E**

1.  Stellar Format Selection >> Number 5th - Humane Operations,

2.  Initiating Self-Reflection >> I assign each Power to Pros and Cons surrounding the Root of the Cause of the issue that I analyze (a.k.a. Climate Change),

3.  Sentient Sensibility Exploration >> Afterwards, it is time to assign each Power to a Practical Sollution. To do so, we expand on ways that each Humane Power of ours can be most Valuable.

4.  Sensible Self-Autonomy Loop >> When we have expanded on the Root of our Issue and visualized on ways that it could be takled, we do what we can to Resolve it. This Last step is also a point where we may Deepen our Analysis through Iteration. We take our latest formed Intentions and assign them as Topics for further Self-Reflection.

5.  Practice makes Perfect.



## 💡 Tips

*   The Stellar Format is synthesized bye Four 5-Pointed Stars and One 6-Pointed Star.

*   Although the majority of the Stars are based on the 5-fold anatomy of the Human Hand, one of them is based on the 6-Freedoms of Movement in Space (Upwards, Downwards, etc.). The 6th extra Dimension represents the Environment of the Model and its whole Ecosystem.
