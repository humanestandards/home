    subtitle: Liberty & Peace for Everyone
    content: >-
      The lack of proper education makes some people wrongly believe that
      Personal Freedom and Good Governance are unrealistic expectations.


      The Humane Standards are a well-grounded research which proves the exact
      opposite.


      Each Human is an Autonomous and Coherent Organism. Autonomy means Freedom,
      and Coherence is only Possible with Good Governance.


      ⚡Self-Empowerment⚡ allows us to embrace our Physical Liberties, and enable
      World Peace.
