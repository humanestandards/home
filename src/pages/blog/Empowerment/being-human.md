> When our Limitations End through Sensible insight, and therefore when all reasons for antagonism and judgement are Resolved - Limitless Power is being born in the form of Love.

**That Love, which is not based on dependence, self-interest, desire and thought - is capable for Humane Empowerment, Continuous Support, and Peaceful Coexistence.**

## The 4 Noble Constitutions of Being

Life is a constitution of Being, which is Meaningful by Design. Therefore, Being our best Self is not a matter of Becoming, but rather a Practical way to Be in the here and now.

To Be, one can Practically do the following:

### 👍 1. Just Be (Infinity)

**The Freedom to Be One's own Self by:**  
1.1. Being Space  
1.2. Being Spacetime  
1.3. Being Human  

### 👌 2. Being Space (Intensity)

**The 2 Freedoms of Space:**  
2.1. Inner Sensation of Detachment (Sensible Processing of Source as the issuer of all Resources)  
2.2. Outer Sensation of Attachment (Sensible Logic of Resources as the issues of One Source)  

### ⌚️ 3. Being Spacetime (Relativity)

**The 3 Freedoms of Spacetime:**  
3.1. Being the Past (Quantum Superposition)  
3.2. Being Present (Wave Function Collapse)  
3.3. Being the Future (Time-Dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE))  

### 🤸‍ 4. Being Human (Behaviors)

**The 6 Freedoms of Movement:**  
4.1. Upward  
4.2. Downward  
4.3. Forward  
4.4. Backward  
4.5. Rightward  
4.6. Leftward  

Since these 4 Classifications of Functions are possible with or without the aid of our intellect, but still express Magnitudes of Intelligence, they can be approached as the Universal Freedoms of the Source of Intelligence.

Through these 11 Freedoms (2 of Space + 3 of Spacetime + 6 of Movement) we can establish **the New Humane Standards**.
