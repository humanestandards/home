We have converted our Fundamental Humane Capabilities to the proceeding Powers, which are then being visualized through Stellar Formations.

Each Stellar Point is being assigned with a Humane Power.

There are lots of ways to learn how they associate with each other, and the easiest way is to begin with just One.

Choose your favorite Star which contains Powers more Relatable to your work or general personality and use them as a Guide for the Organization of your Operations.

## ü§î Problem Solving & Decision Management

Here is a Practical example on how to Practice with the Humane Powers Format:

1.  We choose a Topic we wish to Asses. Something we care to reach a certain Decision and Solve a Problem.

2.  We select our Favorite Stellation,  



## üí° Tips

*   The Stellar Format is synthesized bye Four 5-Pointed Stars and One 6-Pointed Star.

*   Although the majority of the Stars are based on the 5-fold anatomy of the Human Hand, one of them is based on the 6-Freedoms of Movement in Space (Upwards, Downwards, etc.). The 6th extra Dimension represents the Environment of the Model and its whole Ecosystem.
