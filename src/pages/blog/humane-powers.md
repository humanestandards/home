## Using our Hands as Self-Learning Device.

Mnenomics, or Symbolic Association is the most efficient Learning technique.

The Humane Standards use the limbs of our body, such as our hands to help us explore and remember our Humane Powers in a more intuitive manner.

# ⭐ Stellar Format

![](https://preview--home-45e3a.stackbit.dev/\_static/app-assets/Humane%20Powers\_.png)

We have converted our Fundamental Humane Capabilities to the proceeding Powers, which are then being visualized through Stellar Formations.

Each Stellar Point is being assigned with a Humane Power.

There are lots of ways to learn how they associate with each other, and the easiest way is to begin with just One.

Choose your favorite Star which contains Powers more Relatable to your work or general personality and use them as a Guide for the Organization of your Operations.

## 🤔 Problem Solving & Decision Management

Here is a Practical example on how to Practice with the Humane Powers Format:

1.  We choose a Topic we wish to Asses. Something we care to reach a certain Decision and Solve a Problem.

2.  We select our Favorite Stellation, or the one which seems more Relatable to our Topic.

3.  Then we begin Single-Player Sessions or Multi-Player, and expand on the following 3 Directions:

    1.  Sensible Self-Reflection

    2.  Sensible Sentience

    3.  Sensible Self-Autonomy

E X A M P L E

1.  Stellar Format Selection >> Number 5th - Humane Operations,

2.  Initiating Self-Reflection >> I assign each Power to Pros and Cons surrounding the Root of the Cause of the issue that I analyze (a.k.a. Climate Change),

3.  Sentient Sensibility Exploration >> Afterwards, it is time to assign each Power to a Practical Sollution. To do so, we expand on ways that each Humane Power of ours can be most Valuable.

4.  Sensible Self-Autonomy Loop >> When we have expanded on the Root of our Issue and visualized on ways that it could be takled, we do what we can to Resolve it. This Last step is also a point where we may Deepen our Analysis through Iteration. We take our latest formed Intentions and assign them as Topics for further Self-Reflection.

5.  Practice makes Perfect.

## 💡 Tips

*   The Stellar Format is synthesized bye Four 5-Pointed Stars and One 6-Pointed Star.

*   Although the majority of the Stars are based on the 5-fold anatomy of the Human Hand, one of them is based on the 6-Freedoms of Movement in Space (Upwards, Downwards, etc.). The 6th extra Dimension represents the Environment of the Model and its whole Ecosystem.
