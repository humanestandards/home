# Sensible Stencils

> The Standards and Absolute Essentials for the Existence of Life are a Recipe to the Intelligence behind the Existence of Everything.

The Sensible Stencils are Families of Sets in the form of Tables. A Stencil is a Design which you can Copy indefinitely and Adapt to your Plans. Stencils are used by Designers and Architects for ages, and interestingly enough, today we use Stencils to Print Computing Processors on Crystals of Silicon and make Computers of any kind possible.

## How to Read them

- **All Stencils have a 5-fold Rhythm**   
- You can Read the Stencils:
  1. **Horizontally**,
  2. **Vertically**,
  3. **Diagonally**,
  4. **Backwards**, or you can **Mix & Match.**   


The Humane Standards compose a Principled Epistemology of Everything. As a Protocol, it is All-Inclusive and Seamlessly Compliant with all Scientific, Religious and Artistic Disciplines.

Our Sensible Stencils offer a Composition concerning the Five Primal Fields of Humane Intelligence. They are also based on the Colors of the Visible Spectrum; the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye.

Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. That being said, Humane Intelligence turns to be Literally and from a Neurological point of view, the Enlightening Experience of Attentive Intentions.

The Five Fields of Humane Intelligence are the following:

1. **Source** **Processing** Field - Color **White**
2. **Resources** **Logic** Field - Color **Blue**
3. **Service** **Interfaces** Field - Color **Green**
4. **Social** **Networks** Field - Color **Yellow**
5. **Identity** **Operations** Field - Color **Red**
