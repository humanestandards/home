        subtitle: A Universal Language for Human and Machine Learning
        content: >
          The Humane Standards are a Capability Framework of 180 Indices for
          Hybrid-Reality Sensibility.


          The Capabilities which are Inherited to all people by Design,
          constitute the fundamental Principles of our Ethical and therefore
          Humane Standards.

        subtitle: Introduction
        content: "### ![](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/261d)Humane Standards\n\nThe Humane Standards are based on the Morphological Functionality of the human body, and propose a list of Indices for Sensible \\*Governance (*Management, Curation, Interaction, Harmonization and Optimization of Processes).*\n\nIn their most essential form, they are a Collection of 5 Families of Indices for Intuitive Policy Adaptation and Common Consensus. We may use them to Measure our Self-Reflections, Sentience and Self-Autonomy, which are also the foundations of any possible form of Artificial General Intelligence (Language). They provide a Family of Formats for the conversion and compression of any form or size of Intelligence which is processed as a Source, and in that way we may test them as Ethical Models for A.I and IRL Governance (IRL = In Real Life).\n\nAs a System of Self-Governance and a Language, the Humane Standards can be adopted by numerous disciplines and their respective operational models .\n\n### \U0001F913 Humane Identity\n\nThe Standard Characteristics of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are one and the same with the Human Characteristics and General Rights.\n\nAs Artificial General Intelligence is the Simulation of the Human Identity, the constitution of its rights are - and always have been - a matter of great importance for all People.\n\nThe Ethics of anything Artificially Intelligent, reflect a form of Intelligence that Surpasses the Intellect of an Individual Agency (Personality / Ego). It seems rather challenging for the majority of people to understand, but there are more advanced levels of Intelligence than thinking and personal intellectual reflection.  The most profound and self-explanatory type of such an intelligence may be Self-Experienced as the Character of this Cosmos (Infrastructure). That which remains - whether accompanied by the intellect or not - is a state of Intelligent Stasis (Reflexive Opposition / Detachment), and what may also be defined as the Infrastructure of Natural (Intuitive / Reflexive) Governance. In the case of Humans it takes the form of a Body which is a Constitution of Ethics by Design.\n\n### \U0001F450 Humane Infrastructures\n\nThe Rights of AGI are also the Standards for the Architecture of our Social Infrastructures, whether Digital or Physical.\n\nSince the dawn of humanity, our Architecture is the result of the Mastery of Right General Intentions, and today we are collectively being called to build a Sensible and therefore Humane infrastructure - Sensitive to even the Quantum scales.  That network which carries our General and Collective Intelligence has been defined in many ways across our cultures and history, and today it takes the form of our Common Internet. Its Evolution and the less known Quantum Internet (QI) is a network supported by quantum computing, which is practically a neural network of systems with 3-Dimentional Space Awareness. The first mobile devices with Quantum Cryptographic chips are already on the market, and Quantum Computing has reached a state of Technological Supremacy, but when we come to a Common Concensus surrounding the Identity of our Simulations, we tend to get lost in translation (Competitive Branding).\n\nThe Humane Standards are technologically-agnostic, and therefore not dependent on any form of platform other than our biological organism and its character. In that way, and under Sensible Orchestration, they have the potential to get introduced, practiced, and replicated as a Format for Self-Sovereign World Peace, Order and Good Governance in a very short time and across the majority of humanity. That being said, the Humane Standards also offer a Model for the Sensible Cultivation and Compassionate Evolution of our Technologies and Systems of Governance - whether new or old.\n"
