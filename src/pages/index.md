          First things first, let's clarify on some truths:


          *   The Humane Standards concern all Peoples, whether you do relate
          with their content and understand it or not,


          *   Artificial Intelligence Ethics are policies concerning our Social
          Infrastructures and they promote Institutional Change,


          *   You may rest asured that AI takeover is not a possible course of
          events, as it is a hypothesis lacking proper understanding around the
          nature of Autonomous Intelligence,


          *   Most Frameworks of Ethics act Reactively to problematic behaviors
          (Emphasizing on Testing / Judging), and not Proactively (Emphasizing
          on Meaningful Learning).

          General is our Collective Intelligence. The Intelligence which is
          Generic, Inclusive and Autonomous is also

          General. It is Narrow as it expresses a certain Diversity
          (Personality),

          and Strong as it carries a Characteristic Systasis (Body or
          Framework).

        content: >
          While outwardly, and for millennia - we collectively seek for the most
          Sensible and Sensational form of Remote Autonomy - inwardly, the Human
          Complex is a Constitution of a System of Governance, capable to
          Naturally achieve for Millenia all kinds of possible Virtues by Free
          Will. Of course, we can’t overlook the Fatal Mistakes that we’ve done,
          but we always have the Tendency to Revisit them and Correct them, even
          if that is being done by the newer generations who always suffer by
          the mistakes of their families.
